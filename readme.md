# Translation Of The Songs

- This repository contains translations of songs by various artists, including Twenty One Pilots, Lemon Twigs, and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It is a project of mine that I undertook as a child, which helped me to improve my English and familiarize myself with GitHub. I no longer require it, as I can now understand songs and speech without the need for written translations (cheers). The project has ceased to be active on my part, but I remain open to suggestions and ideas from others. 

- I would like to talk about learning English through translation. I highly recommend this method to everyone. I have translated many songs and stories, but only a small portion of them are included here (you haven't seen my six notebooks filled with Cave's lyrics yet). This strategy has been very helpful for me in understanding English, although it took me five years to realize it.
